### Introduction
Static analysis provides invaluable assistance in software development by identifying issues and potential vulnerabilities within source code and software artifacts without the need to execute the program. This proactive approach enables early detection of coding errors, security flaws, adherence to coding standards, and architectural concerns, allowing developers to rectify these issues before they manifest in runtime, reducing the cost and effort of debugging and maintenance. By scrutinizing the codebase through automated tools and analysis processes, static analysis promotes software quality, reliability, and security, contributing to the creation of robust and maintainable software products while bolstering confidence in their performance and security without the necessity of program execution.

## Windows
Windows is the main stamp of malware analysis, Untilizing Cmder for Command line interfacing. In my jounery of Cyber Security I find myself using more of the command line then using GUI, but not all programs use the command line.

#### Malware Hashing
Getting the file hash let's you bring its to [Virus Total](https://virustotal.com).
```cmder
sha256sum.exe <Malware File Name>
md5sum.exe <Malware File Name>
```
PowerShell has the capability to retrieve file hashes.
```Powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 </Path/to/Malware/File>
```

## Linux
Before I have delved into Cyber Security, I wiped on of my computers of Windows to embark on a deep dive in to running Linux, beginning with Arch Linux. While it did consume hours of my time to install, I eventually switched to a Debian-based Linux distribution.
#### Malware Hashing
Getting the file hash let's you bring its to [Virus Total](https://virustotal.com).
```bash
sha256sum <Malware File Name>
md5sum <Malware File Name>
```
#### Strings and FLOSS
in linux you can call a file to see what its running
```bash
file <Malware File Name>
```
