<p>EmbedDLL is composed of a 64-bit script that sets up two payloads. The sample our team was able to recover was titled 'embed.xml' and 'embed.vbs,' which were then executed when interacting with the DLL.Upon execution, EmbedDLL loads itself into the system's memory, initiating the deployment of two distinct payloads. Notable symptoms of infection include sporadic beaconing activities to various URLs outlined in Appendix B. Additionally, indicators of compromise involve data theft, alongside the creation of "embed.vbs" and "embed.xml" files within the C:/Users/Public directory.</p>
<p>YARA signature rules are attached in Appendix A. Malware sample and hashes have been submitted to VirusTotal for further examination.</p>

### High-Level Summary

<p>EmbedDLL consists of one component: an encrypted dropper that loads a VBS script into the registry. Upon login, it establishes communication with its callback DNS server (src[.]masterchiefsgruntemporium[.]local)</p>

#### Mitre Att&ck
These attack pattern can be mapped on MITRE ATT&CK framework as,

- Defense Evasion
<p>Technique: Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)</p>
<p>Description: Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.</p>

- Discovery
<p>Technique: System Information Discovery (T1082)</p>
<p>Description: An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. Adversaries may use the information from System Information Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.</p>

### Basic Dynamic Analysis

<p>Writes Files on to disk, the first payload setups up a .vbs and a .xml files.</p>

*File create*

<p>Incorporating a degree of persistence ensures that the system automatically restarts even in the event of a computer reboot.</p>

<img src="./Pics/persistenthandler.png" align="center">

*persistent handler*

<p>With all the gathered information of the system, it saves a config file of the system. Then enables FipsAlgorithomPolicy.</p>

### Advanced Static Analysis

<p>The process involves embedding the DLL file 'EmbedDLL.dll,' reading its content to a string, converting it from Base64 encoding using 'FromBase64String,' retrieving environment variables with 'GetEnvironmentVariable,' and subsequently writing the content to a file using 'WriteAllText.</p>
