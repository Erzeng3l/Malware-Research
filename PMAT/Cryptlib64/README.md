<p>EmbedDLL is a 64-bit dynamic-link library (DLL) file that generates two files within the public directory. Upon execution, it utilizes the 'GetEnvironmentVariable' function to retrieve sensitive data from the entire system and subsequently employs 'WriteAllText' to store this information. The system is configured to establish a Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) connection, through which it transmits all created files. Furthermore, EmbedDLL operates with active persistence as a grunt agent on a Command and Control (C2) server. </p>
<p>YARA signature rules are attached in Appendix A. Malware sample and hashes have been submitted to VirusTotal for further examination.</p>

### High-Level Summary


### Malware Compromise
EmbedDLL is composed of a 64-bit script that sets up two payloads. The sample our team was able to recover was titled 'embed.xml' and 'embed.vbs,' which were then executed when interacting with the DLL.

#### Mitre Att&ck
These attack pattern can be mapped on MITRE ATT&CK framework as,

- Defense Evasion
<p>Technique: Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)
Description: Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.</p>

- Discovery
<p>Technique: System Information Discovery (T1082)
Description: An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. Adversaries may use the information from System Information Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.</p>
