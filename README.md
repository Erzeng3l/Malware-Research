# Practial Malware Analysis and Trige (PMAT)

This course starts out setting up a Malware analysis lab environment, then getting into Basic Static Analysis. About 32% of the course is setting up the lab. I have gotten into a problem with the lab not wanting to use inetsim to act as a network to bring me to any .com address. My fix for this was to add the dns to the Npcap loppback adapter. I plan to use this as a place to write my notes and reports to and possibly have other reports as i get better in analyzing malware.

For the virtual machine you'll need to setup one for windows 10 with Flare-VM and one on REMnux linux.
